      "summary": "Giannis Klearchou Xenakis made his grand entrance into the world in Romania, born to Greek parents who, quite impressively, had a flair for both business and music. His early years were less of a rock concert and more of a solo flute performance, thanks to his mother\u2019s influence and his festivities at the Bayreuth Festival.",
