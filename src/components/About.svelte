    This web app displays timelines of events and works for selected composers.
    Ever wondered what Haydn was about when Mozart composed his first symphony,
    what Wagner was brewing when Bizet released Carmen, or what was happening in
    the world the year Chopin released his Etudes? This app is for you!

  <p>
    The events were collected and summarized by ChatGPT (read more <a>here</a>!)
    and yes, they can be janky at times, but overall I found them pretty useful.
    The compositions (and links to PDFs) are scraped from IMSLP, so only works
    in the public domain are referenced. >.

    Go to <a>the project's Github page</a> to learn more about the project and how
    to add/request other composers.
