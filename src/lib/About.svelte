    Because all these people had depressing lives, I asked ChatGPT to "add some
    fun" to the write-ups. However ChatGPT is very difficult to rein in when it
    comes to humor. Watch it as it often misses the mark, abuses tired dad-puns,
    resorts to stereotypes, and mocks tragic events through the lives of your
    favorite artists!
