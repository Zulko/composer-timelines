    Because all these people had depressing lives, I also asked ChatGPT to add
    some fun in the write-ups, but it proved difficult to control. If that's
    your thing, watch it as it often misses the mark, abuses tired dad-puns,
    resorts to stereotypes, and mocks tragic events through the lives of your
    favorite artists!
