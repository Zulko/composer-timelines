He introduced the 'fundamental law' of Western music, which sounds like he was trying to play music by the rules of a strict math teacher. His approach was filled with math and a sprinkle of didacticism, all to make sense of the musical chaos! Thanks to his groundbreaking theories, Rameau became a household name in France and a pillar of music theory."
