He's now a legend in the wood and glue world, known for crafting violins and cellos that could make even the grumpiest musician break into song (or at least not throw their instrument out the window). With enough talent to challenge a wizard with a wand, Guadagnini's creations have become staples in orchestras everywhere, proving once and for all that music isn't just for pigeons\u2014especially when it\u2019s played on a Guadagnini!"
