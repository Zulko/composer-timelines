To top it off, he was a historian of music, which means he spent a lot of time digging through dusty sheet music and yelling at clouds, all in the name of preserving the glorious sounds of yesteryear. Quite the busy fellow!"

But then he dropped the choral banger 'Jerusalem', and suddenly it was like a sparkly disco ball had dropped into a church service. Talk about turning those hymns up to eleven! Parry became the talk of the town, all while still trying to figure out how to get his cat to stop knocking over music stands.  \n\nSo here\u2019s to Parry, the accidental rockstar of choral music, who clearly knew how to make those choir robes shimmer!"

Can you imagine a room full of serious musicians suddenly breaking into song about the joys of academic life? It was a major milestone in his career, and one that probably came with a fancy desk and unlimited coffee!"
