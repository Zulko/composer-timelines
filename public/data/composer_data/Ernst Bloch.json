      "fun_version": "Ernst Bloch, originally named Ernst Simon Bloch (because one name was just not sufficient for all his philosophical musings), popped into the world bringing an impressive dose of German heritage along with him. Little did his parents know, their baby boy would eventually grow up to philosophize about dreams, hope, and probably why wearing socks with sandals is an eternal dilemma!"

Unfortunately, it seems their wedding vows came with a side of bad luck, as she took the express route to the afterlife just a few years later. Talk about a relationship that ended on the rocks\u2014though not the good kind you find in a cocktail!"

She left behind a husband who probably thought getting remarried would be easier than reordering his coffee. But alas, finding love is a little less like picking a movie and a lot more like navigating a maze!"

This masterpiece dives deep into themes of hope and how to survive existential crises without resorting to binge-watching cat videos.
